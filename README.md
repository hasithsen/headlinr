### Setup

1. Clone with git or downlad zip. Leave directory structure unchanged.
2. Add absolute path to ```headlinr.sh``` in your ```.*rc```.
3. If ```lolcat``` is not present, remove it from ```headlinr.sh```

Ex:

If ```headlinr.sh``` is inside ```~/headlinr/```, add ```~/headlinr/headlinr.sh``` to ```~/.*rc```

### Test

Run ```exec *``` to replace current session with a new one.
